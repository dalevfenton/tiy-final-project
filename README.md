## The Iron Yard - Final Project
A "single page" web app allowing users to plot out and save road trip routes

This project was executed over the course of three weeks as the final project of
 the Iron Yard Front End Engineering Course. The project is built with React.js
 and uses the Mapbox API and javascript SDK to display and plot maps, routes,
 and waypoints. The project also uses a Parse Server to persist data and a Node
 proxy to make cross origin API calls to the MyGasFeed and Yelp APIs. It is fully
 responsive and works well on phones and tablets as well as desktop.

A Live and Functioning version of the site is live and located at:
